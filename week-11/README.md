### Mono Repo

> _A monorepo (short for "monolithic repository") is a software development and version control strategy where multiple projects or components of a software system are stored in a single, centralized repository. In a monorepo, all related code, libraries, and dependencies are managed together in a single version control system (e.g., Git)._ This is in contrast to a multi-repository approach where each project or component has its own separate repository.

Key characteristics and benefits of a monorepo include:

1. Code Sharing: In a monorepo, code sharing is simplified because all components or projects are in one repository. This can promote code reuse and consistency across different parts of the system.

2. Easier Cross-Project Refactoring: When you make changes to one part of the codebase, you can easily update all dependent projects within the same repository. This simplifies cross-project refactoring and ensures that all projects are kept in sync.

3. Shared Tooling: You can share build, test, and deployment tooling across all projects in the monorepo, which can lead to a more consistent and efficient development process.

4. Dependency Management: Managing dependencies becomes more straightforward since all projects share the same set of dependencies. This can help prevent version conflicts and streamline updates.

5. Atomic Commits: Changes to multiple projects can be committed atomically, ensuring that all parts of the system are in a consistent state.

6. Single CI/CD Pipeline: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be centralized for the entire monorepo, making it easier to manage automated testing and deployments.

7. Simplified Versioning: Versioning of projects within a monorepo can be coordinated, making it easier to ensure compatibility and track changes.

8. Enhanced Collaboration: Developers can easily collaborate on different parts of the system in the same repository, leading to better communication and shared knowledge.

9. Performance: Monorepos can provide performance benefits by reducing the need to clone and manage multiple repositories on local development machines.

- Checkpoint a mono repo in next.js + ts
- Mono repo in Nextjs
- Marination
- Building an end to end mono repo in NextJS + TS

- Steps to follow
  - Init a turbo mono repo(npx create-turbo@latest )
  - add a nextjs app with the page route in TS
  - Update next.config.js to use ui as an internal package
  - Export right set of commponents from ui
  - Install mui(react dependency will complain) -- an opportunity for an open source contribution
  - Put a simple signup/signin component (npm i from top)
  - Start adding backend, create a new db module(internal?)
  - Where should db.connect be? Cache it in a file of its own
  - Connect frontend to backend(notice no cors?)
  - Introduce store as a new module, transpile it
  - Introduce components folder for appbar
